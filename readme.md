# Actions Demo

TODO:

- [ ] Generate release notes with reference to all commits since last release (currently only showing most recent commit message)
- [ ] Create trigger for workflow in different repository
- [ ] Dynamically get Github username for the repository owner so one action can be used for all users (not hardcoded to a single user)
